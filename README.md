# Creating scatter plots for sleep variables

The first thing we did was clean the data from the "Sleep_Efficiency.csv" file. Rows with missing values were dropped
and columns turned into numerical data types.

We then used the correlation coefficient corr() method to determine the correlation coefficients.

Afterward, we created a plot with r-squared values and lines of regression to be charted on the graphs for the targeted
variables. We saved and exported the graphs as image files for later use in the project slide deck.
