### Who Participated in the Study: Analysis of Participants and Limitations using Tableau Dashboard
The 407 individuals on average slept 7.5hrs, exercised 1.7 times per week with a mode of 3x per week followed closely by 0x per week, and have an average sleep efficiency score of 0.78 (we will explain later the significance of the sleep efficiency score). Note that the higher the better! By visualizing respondents by age and gender we can determine limitations of our data set as well as opportunities for deeper exploration. For example, 20% of the study are men in their 50s, yet women in their 50s are only 3.8% of the respondent group. Observing some of their habits, we learned that women in their 50s and 60s seem to be experiencing poor sleep quality, some of whom drink equivalent amounts to men in their 20s. On the other hand, women in their 40s seem to be more active and well rested than younger women in their 20s. With further clinical studies and surveys we can dig deeper into lifestyle implications on sleep which would make machine learning even more effective.

### Data Vizualization in Tableau: Sleep Efficiency and Deep Sleep Colored With Alcohol Consumption
---
There is a strong correlation between the output values of sleep efficiency and deep sleep percentage as shown on the graph. The more time spent in deep sleep during the sleep cycle (values moving upward on the x-axis), the better the sleep efficiency (values moving right on the y-axis).Coloring the graph based on alcohol consumption - which is a lifestyle choice - we see that the upper right hand quadrant appears lighter in color suggesting less alcohol consumption leads to more restful and restorative sleep. To be exact, 79% of respondents who are getting quality sleep, reported having 0 -1 drink the day before sleep study.

### Data Vizualization in Tableau: Sleep Efficiency and Deep Sleep Colored With Exercise Frequency
---
This is the same sleep efficiency and deep sleep graph as previously shown, except now layering the effects of exercising instead of alcohol consumption. Exercising is said to be a positive lifestyle choice and it shows. We calculated that 77% of respondents who are getting efficient and deep quality sleep, reported exercising weekly.
